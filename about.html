          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p> I am Abdul Karim Shaikh here and i am making the simple  html and css web page With over a decade of development knowledge  I realized that the typical product creation
            process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
            the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
            user.
          </p>

          <p>There is a website to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I Make the project not only do I work to submit my Assignment and  I ensure that the project is aligning properly.</p>
